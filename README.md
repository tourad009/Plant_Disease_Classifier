# 🌿 Plant Leaf Disease Classification

This notebook was developed as part of a deep learning project using [FastAI](https://www.fast.ai/) on **Kaggle**.

## 🧪 Objective
Build a multiclass classifier to detect various plant leaf diseases from image data.

## 🛠 Tools & Frameworks
- Python, FastAI, PyTorch
- Transfer Learning with ResNet
- Data Augmentation
- Training & evaluation done in Kaggle environment

## 🚀 Highlights
- Achieved high validation accuracy on multiple classes
- Used FastAI's high-level API for rapid experimentation
- Leveraged Kaggle’s GPU environment for training

## 📁 Note
This notebook uses Kaggle-specific paths like `Path("/kaggle/input/...")`.  
To run it, open the notebook directly on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/touradouadara/multiclass-plant-leaf-disease-classifier).
